# GraphTesting
This folder contains all R code files and the corresponding data used in the paper "Two-sample hypothesis testing for latent distance graphs with unknown link functions".

## Simulations:
- **functions.r** is a collection of all self-defined functions.
- **examples.r** contains the parameter settings used in the paper. Run this file then you can get all tables and figures showed in the simulation section and the supplementary materials.
## Applications:
- The folder **application_1** includes the data and an R code file, named "main.r", used in the first application. The data is from Faskowitz, J., Yan, X., Zuo, X.-N. & Sporns, O. (2018), 'Weighted stochastic block models of the human connectome across the life span', Scientific Reports 8(1), 1â€“16.
- The folder **application_2** includes the data and an R code files, named "main.r", used in the second application.  The data is available from the UCI Machine
Learning Repository and used in Andrzejak, R. G. et al. (2001), 'Indications of nonlinear deterministic and finite-dimensional
structures in time series of brain electrical activity: Dependence on recording region and
brain state', Physical Review E 64(6), 061907.
