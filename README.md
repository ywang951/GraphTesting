## R files:
- **functions.r** is a collection of all self-defined functions.
- **figure1.r** is to create Figure 1 in the paper.
- **figure2.r** is to create Figure 2 in the paper.
- **bootstrap.r** is to generate the power and p-values used in Figure 1 & 2 via bootstrap.
- **permutation_test.r** is to generate the power and p-values used in Figure 1 & 2  ia permutation test.
- **nmds_comparison.r** is to generate Table 2.
- **sparsity.r** is to generate Table B.1 in the supplementary materials.
- **vertices_detection.r** is to generate Figure B.1 in the supplementary materials.
- **app1_fig3.r** is to generate Figure 3 of the first empirical study.
- **app1_tblC1.r** is to generate Table C.1 of the first empirical study in the supplementary materials.
- **app2.r** is to generate Table 3 in the second empirical study.

## Data:
- **participants.csv** and the folder **counts** are the real data used in the first empirical study.
